        <p class="lead mb-4">- My experience ranges from event working to volunteering. I regularly work events for the Artisans Trading Co. We set up booths at events such as First Friday in Las Vegas or at the LA County Fair. This family ran company connects with artists local in California and collaborates with them to create and sell unique merchandise such as enamel pins, patches, stickers, and more.  Working here I have learned amazing networking and people skills making me an efficient Sales Associate. I enjoy conversing with customers and informing them on deals and special facts about what our craft concerns. I also adapted by learning Square transaction technology and tedious restocking and packages processes. I also regularly run my own small business where I set up at flea markets and sell my own merchandise including hair accessories, clothing, art prints, pins, and so much more, all made by me! During this process I exercise my abilities to create displays, marketing, and creative product design.<br><br>

        - A lot of my experience also comes from my volunteer work. IVRS is a recovery center in San Bernardino California, at this establishment we provide resources and necessities for the homeless population in the area. My part in this involved the events thrown during holiday seasons (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, ect.) I would help to plan layouts, activities, and meal plans for these events. In addition, my family and I would take initiative to make items like easter baskets, desserts, and sanitary bags to pass out at these events. Apart from planning I would help to run the clothes closet providing clothes for the homeless, help serve the hot food, as well as being an on foot helper which means I fill in when there is a task that needs attention. To expand on my ability to take on large tasks, in high school I was involved in ASB which required me to be reliable and crafty at football games, rallies, and dances. We would not only plan but also craft props and execute these events. We were in charge of all of the rallies, dances, and just about every campus event there  was. During this time I exercised my time management skills, as well as my ability to do multiple tasks and problem solve. These events were long hours and hard labor.<br><br>

        - On top of my time in ASB I was also involved in AVID which is a college bound program where I later became an officer for (Ambassador). During this time I would prepare and help run events for the program. Behind the scenes we set up park clean ups, dances and other activities for our students. I was also involved in an immense amount of community service including park clean ups and community events with Project Boon. I also spent an immense amount of time in Art Club where we would also help to plan the creative aspect of events, we ran booths at games, painted murals around the school, and host annual Art Shows for the students to display their creations.
